    <h2>Data collected by the app</h2>
    I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any
    personally identifiable information. All data created by the you (the
    user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
    No analytics software is present in the app either.
